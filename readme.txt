This is our implementation of Project 4,
to sovle the knapsack problem using the traditional and "memory function" approach of dynamic programming,
as well as the "greedy" approach.

Must Have:
c++ 17

Contains the following files
readme.txt
main.cpp
makefile
knapsack.h
knapsack.cpp
max_heap.h
max_heap.cpp
file_reader.h
file_reader.cpp
Project4_report.pdf

The report is stored in here under the name Project4_report.pdf.
To run the project, move it onto the blue server.
After reaching the directory where the project files are, run the command: make
After running this command, a file called project4.x will be created.

make sure all files you wish to test are in the file called "KnapsackTestData"

To run the project, enter this command: ./project4.x anIntegerThatIndicatesInputFile
*Note the command should follow this format.
